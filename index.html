    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <h3>My name is Clair! I'm an artist, writer, adventurer... and now, a coding student!</h3>

        <blockquote><b><u>About Me:</u></b></blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>Before Codeworks, I was three years out of college with a English degree and working at the Idaho Humane Society
        at the front desk. While I enjoyed the work, it
        wasn't really something that was fulfilling to me. I felt like I needed something more--something where I could
        work and improve myself as a person and a professional. So I decided to join CodeWorks so I had something to
        look forwards to and something to challenge me and take me farther in life. </p>

        <blockquote><b><u>My Goals and Expectations:</u></b></blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>Of course, the main thing I'm hoping to get out of the course is the experience and knowledge needed to start a
        career as a software developer. However, that's not all I hope for:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>I want to cultivate a sense of pride in where I'm at in life. Instead of feeling like I'm going nowhere, I
            want
            to feel like I'm going somehwere. When someone asks me "What do you do?" I want to be excited to answer
            them:
            "I'm attending a coding bootcamp to become a junior software developer."</li>
        <li>I hope to make connections with both instructors and students, professionally and personally.</li>
        <li>I hope to hone not only my coding skills, but also my interview and portfolio skills so that I am prepared
            to
            get a job in the market.</li>
        <li>I want to have fun!</li>
    </ol>
