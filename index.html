    </div><h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <h3>My name is Clair!</h3>
    <!-- What I did before codeworks -->
    <p>Before Codeworks, I was working at the Idaho Humane Society at the front desk. While I enjoyed the work, it wasn't really something that was fulfilling to me. So I decided to join CodeWorks so I had something to look forwards to and something to challenge me and take me farther in life. </p>
    <!-- what i hope to get out of course -->
    <p>Of course, the main thing I'm hoping to get out of the course is the experience and knowledge needed to start a career as a software developer. However, that's not all I hope for:</p>
    <li>
        <li>I want to cultivate a sense of pride in where I'm at in life. Instead of feeling like I'm going nowhere, I want to feel like I'm going somehwere. When someone asks me "What do you do?" I want to be excited to answer them: "I'm attending a coding bootcamp to become a junior software developer."</li>
        <li>I hope to make connections with both instructors and students, professionally and personally.</li>
        <li>I hope to hone not only my coding skills, but also my interview and portfolio skills so that I am prepared to get a job in the market.</li>
        <li>I want to have fun!</li>
    </li>
